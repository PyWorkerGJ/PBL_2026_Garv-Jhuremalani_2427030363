#  Plant Disease Detector with AI Image Validation System

A secure **deep learning–based system** that detects plant diseases while verifying image authenticity using a **two-stage AI pipeline**. This ensures **reliable predictions** by preventing AI-generated or manipulated images from influencing disease classification.

##  Overview

Traditional plant disease detection systems assume that all input images are authentic. However, **AI-generated images can mislead models** and produce incorrect predictions.

This project introduces an **authenticity verification stage** before disease classification to ensure **trustworthy and secure results**.

The system uses **ResNet-18 Convolutional Neural Networks** to:

- Detect whether an image is **Real or Fake**
- Classify plant disease only if the image is **authentic**
